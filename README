This is an add-on module for Sybase::CTlib (which is part of the
sybperl distribution) and which makes writing perl scripts using
Sybase a little easier, by defining higher level calls such as 
Scalar(), HashRow(), ExecSql(), etc.

When using this module it is usually not necessary to really understand
the Sybase API, as it makes sure that ct_results() is called the correct
number of times, and that all the data rows are fetched, for example.

As Sybase::Simple is sub-classed from Sybase::CTlib all the regular
API calls are still available for advanced operations.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

NOTE: When running the test script Sybase::Simple needs access to a 
Sybase server. You can specify the server, username and password in the 
environment by setting $DSQUERY, $SYBASE_USER and $SYBASE_PWD, or you
can edit the PWD file and set the UID, PWD and SRV variables.

If all went well, run make install to place this module in the regular 
perl library directory.
