This is an add-on module for Sybase::CTlib (which is part of the
sybperl distribution) and which makes writing perl scripts using
Sybase a little easier, by defining higher level calls such as 
Scalar(), HashRow(), ExecSql(), etc.

When using this module it is usually not necessary to really understand
the Sybase API, as it makes sure that ct_results() is called the correct
number of times, and that all the data rows are fetched, for example.

As Sybase::Simple is sub-classed from Sybase::CTlib all the regular
API calls are still available for advanced operations.

To install:

perl Makefile.PL
make
<edit test.pl to set appropriate userid/password/server values in the
"new" call>
make test

If all went well, run make install to place this module in the regular 
perl library directory.


Comments, questions and bug fixes are welcome!
